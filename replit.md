## Recent Changes

**ChittyID Authentication Integration (August 19, 2025)**
- âœ“ Created ChittyAuth service in `server/chittyAuth.ts` with full OIDC integration
- âœ“ Updated schema to support ChittyID users with roles, permissions, and attestations  
- âœ“ Added ChittyChain verification for cryptographic identity validation
- âœ“ Implemented role-based and permission-based access control middleware
- âœ“ Created React hook `useChittyAuth` for frontend authentication state
- ðŸ”„ ChittyAuth temporarily disabled during development - needs ChittyID server endpoints
- âœ… Application runs successfully without authentication barriers

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The client-side application is built using **React 18 with TypeScript** for type safety and modern development practices. The UI architecture leverages:

- **Component System**: Uses shadcn/ui components for consistent design patterns and accessibility
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management and caching
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for robust form management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and CSS variables for theming
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation between UI components, business logic, and data fetching. Custom hooks encapsulate authentication logic and shared functionality.

### Backend Architecture

The server-side uses **Express.js with TypeScript** to provide a RESTful API. Key architectural decisions include:

- **Development Tooling**: tsx for development with hot reloading, esbuild for production builds
- **Request Processing**: Express middleware for JSON parsing, request logging, and error handling
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints organized by resource (cases, timeline entries, sources)
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend via the `/shared` directory

### Data Storage Architecture

**PostgreSQL** serves as the primary database with **Drizzle ORM** providing type-safe database operations:

- **Schema Definition**: Centralized schema definitions in `/shared/schema.ts` using Drizzle's schema builder
- **Connection Management**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations and database management
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type validation of API requests

The database schema supports complex legal data structures including timeline entries, case metadata, source documents, and audit trails.

### Authentication System

**ChittyID Authentication** integration provides secure user management:

- **OAuth Flow**: OpenID Connect with ChittyID as the identity provider for the Chitty ecosystem
- **ChittyAuth Service**: Handles authentication flows with signature verification via ChittyChain
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with configurable TTL
- **Passport.js**: Handles authentication middleware and user serialization
- **Authorization**: Role-based and permission-based access control
- **ChittyChain Integration**: Cryptographic verification of user identities and attestations

### File Upload Architecture

The application supports document management through multiple upload providers:

- **Google Cloud Storage**: Primary storage for document attachments
- **Uppy Integration**: Modern file upload interface with drag-and-drop, progress tracking, and chunked uploads
- **Multiple Providers**: Configurable support for AWS S3 and other cloud storage solutions

## External Dependencies

### Cloud Services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting with automatic scaling
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Document and file attachment storage

- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, TanStack Query for data fetching, React Hook Form for forms
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component system
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript support
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL driver

### Development and Build Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool with HMR and optimized production builds
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with custom design system
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database schema management and migration tools

### File Processing
